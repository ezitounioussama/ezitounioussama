# Hi there, I'm Oussama Ezitouni üëã

## About Me

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with 3 years of experience in creating responsive and interactive web applications. My skills include JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and other languages that I have picked up along the way.

## Passion for Full-Stack Development

While I have experience with Full-Stack Development, my true passion lies in Full-Stack Web Development. I find joy in creating beautiful and responsive websites using modern JavaScript frameworks. As a junior developer, I may not have extensive experience, but I make up for it with my passion and drive to learn. I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and knowledge in this field.

## Looking for Opportunities to Grow

I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. I am looking for an opportunity to join a company where I can grow and learn as a Full-Stack Developer and where I can put my skills to use in real-world projects.
